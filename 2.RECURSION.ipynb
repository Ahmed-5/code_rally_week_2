    "Our `binary_search()` function calls the `binary_search_func()` function. So the time complexity of the function is entirely dependent on the time complexity of the `binary_search_func()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input here is an array, so our time complexity will be determined in terms of the size of the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like we did earlier, let's say the time complexity of `binary_search_func()` is a function of the input size, `n`. In other words, the time complexity is $T(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also keep in mind that we are usually concerned with the worst-case time complexity, and that is what we will calculate here. In the worst case, the `target` value will not be present in the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `binary_search_func()` function, we first check for the base case. If the base case does not return `True`, we calculate the `mid_index` and then compare the element at this `mid_index` with the `target` values. All the operations are independent of the size of the array. Therefore, we can consider all these independent operations as taking a combined time, $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from these constant time operations, we do just one other task. We either make a call on the left-half of the array, or on the right half of the array. By doing so, we are reducing the input size by $n/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: Remember that we usually consider large input sizes while calculating time complexity; there is no significant difference between $10^5$ and ($10^5 + 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our new function call is only called with half the input size. \n",
    "We said that $T(n)$ was the time complexity of our original function. The time complexity of the function when called with half the input size will be $T(n/2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T(n) = T(n/2) + k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in the next step, the time complexity of the function called with half the input size would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T(n/2) = T(n/4) + k$$\n",

    "1. $T(n)\\ \\ \\  = T(n/2) + k$\n",
    "2. $T(n/2) = T(n/4) + k$\n",

    "$^{(1)}$ If we have only one element, we go to 0 elements next\n",
    "\n",
    "From our binary search section, we know that it takes $log(n)$ steps to go from $T(n)$ to $1$. Therefore, when we add the corresponding left-hand sides and right-hand sides, we can safely say that:\n",

    "$$T(n) = log(n) * k $$\n",
